## Documentation Philosophy

This documentation follows these principles:
- **Modular**: Documentation is split by concern, matching the codebase structure
- **AI-Friendly**: Clear structure and symlinks help AI agents find relevant context
- **Single Responsibility**: Each document addresses one specific concept or area
- **Concise**: Avoid duplication by referencing shared concepts across documents
